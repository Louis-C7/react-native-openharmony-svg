# @louisc7/react-native-oh-svg

This project is the OpenHarmony platform adaptation of [react-native-svg](https://github.com/software-mansion/react-native-svg) and a self-maintained fork of [@react-native-oh-tpl/react-native-svg](https://github.com/react-native-oh-library/react-native-harmony-svg). While `@react-native-oh-tpl/react-native-svg` continues to be maintained by other teams, this version is my personal project, maintained out of personal interest.

**Dependency:** This library requires [react-native-openharmony](https://gitcode.com/openharmony-sig/ohos_react_native).
